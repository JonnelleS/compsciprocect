    <br>
    <p> To learn math first you must understand the key elements: 
    <ul>
        <li> Addition "+"</li>
        <li> Subtraction "-"</li>
        <li> Multiplication "*"</li>
     <li> Division "รท"</li>
    </ul> </p> 
    <p> Adding is when numbers are collectively added to the other for example 1+1=2 or 3+4=7 which is learned by counting on fingers. Subtraction is the opposite by taking away the amount of numbers from the original. Examples are 3-2+1 and 9-2=7.</p> 
    <p> There are many rules to multiplication and division. <br> Some include: 
    <ul> <li> When multiplying a number by zero(0) the answer is always 0. </li>
    <li> </li>
    </ul></p>
